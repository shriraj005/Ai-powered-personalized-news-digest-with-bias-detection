Installation Steps
Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

If requirements.txt is not available:

pip install torch transformers gradio newspaper3k matplotlib

 Running the Application

Navigate to project root directory:

cd Project_Name

Then run:

python src/app.py

After running successfully, you will see:

 How to Use the System
Option 1: Enter Article URL

Paste a news article URL

Click Submit

Option 2: Paste Raw Text

Paste news content directly

Click Submit

System will:

Extract content

Summarize article

Detect bias (Left / Right / Center)

Generate neutral version

Show bias comparison graph

Display bias reduction %


 Models Used

Summarization Model: facebook/bart-large-cnn

Bias Detection Model: facebook/bart-large-mnli

Framework: HuggingFace Transformers

Models will automatically download on first run.

Troubleshooting
🔹 Error: CUDA not available

Solution:

Install correct PyTorch version

Or run on CPU (default fallback)

🔹 Error: newspaper3k fails to extract article

Solution:

Try copy-pasting raw text instead of URL

🔹 Slow performance

Solution:

Use GPU

Or reduce model to bart-base

8️⃣ Performance Notes

First run may take time (model download)

Subsequent runs will be faster

GPU significantly improves performance
